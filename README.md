# **My Portfolio**

**My Portfolio**, features a website that serves a place to showcase recent work and as a way for prospective employers to reach out and get in touch. As I am currently taking a program in web development this site will frequently be updated as I learn new technologies and techniques. 

The goal was to build a single page web application using knowledge relevant to the weekly materials such as *flexbox* and *flexgrid* while meeting the following criteria and matching the appearance and functionality of the provided mock-up:

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
